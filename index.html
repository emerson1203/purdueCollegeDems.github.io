        <h2> College Democrats of Purdue </h2>
        <p> 
            Welcome to College Democrats of Purdue! We are a recently <i>re</i>-formed club, after the original club was discontinued a few years ago.
            We're very excited to be back. Our main goal is educating Purdue students about current politics, United States government, and how to get 
            more involved! 
        </p>
        <h2> Meeting Schedule </h2>
        <p>
            Meetings take place every other week on [day of the week]'s, alternating between educational and action meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meetings are split into two types: educational meetings and action meetings. For educational meetings, members of the club vote on a topic to 
            discuss and learn more about. We learn about topics such as local elections, checks and balances, and histories of political movements to 
            provide club members with a better understanding of the functions of government. Action meetings are related to current events, allowing 
            club members to get involved and make a difference. We attend protests, host tabling, and collaborate with other political clubs on campus.
